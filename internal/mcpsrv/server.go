Two things are worth knowing up front.

Hyper-V reports a VM as Running well before its guest OS has finished booting.
After start_vm, call wait_for_guest_ip before assuming the VM is reachable.

There are two ways to reach a service inside a VM, and they solve different
problems. A tunnel forwards a host port and works for anything whose client can
be pointed at a port; use mode "ssh" when the service is bound to the guest's own
127.0.0.1, because no direct route reaches that. An External virtual switch gives
the guest its own address on the physical LAN, which is the only option when the
host already holds the port (SMB, RDP, WinRM), when the protocol is sensitive to
host identity, or when other machines must reach the guest directly.

A VM's name is an identity here, not a label. Stored credentials, the pinned SSH
host key and every open tunnel are filed under it. Renaming a VM any other way
leaves all three behind and this server stops recognising it — no credentials, no
pin, so the next connection is treated as a first sighting and a changed host key
is trusted in silence. Use rename_vm, which carries them across.

Guest-facing tools split by where their mechanism lives, and the split decides
which guests they work on. capture_vm_screen, send_vm_key and send_vm_mouse
drive Hyper-V's own console devices, so they work whatever the guest runs — or
even when nothing is running yet. guest_invoke_command and guest_run_in_session
go through PowerShell Direct and are Windows-only; the Linux equivalent is
ssh_exec. guest_copy_file works on both, but a Linux guest needs hypervfcopyd
from hyperv-daemons.

A Windows guest can be driven before it has any network at all.
guest_invoke_command runs a command over the VMBus and gets an unfiltered
administrator token, so installing features and writing under HKLM work with no
prompt to answer. It needs a password; an SSH key is not enough for that
transport.

Anything graphical needs one more step, and skipping it fails quietly.
guest_invoke_command lands in session 0, which has no desktop: a window opened
there is drawn nowhere, a screen capture taken there is blank, and UI automation
finds no elements — all without an error. Use guest_run_in_session to run in the
logged-on user's session instead. It is elevated too, so it is also the way to
drive a program that needs administrator and shows a window. It needs somebody
logged on, which means the guest needs automatic logon arranged.

To see a VM at all, capture_vm_screen reads the console from the host and needs
nothing running inside the guest — it is the only way to look at a firmware
prompt, a boot menu, a stop error, or an installer waiting on a dialog.
send_vm_key and send_vm_mouse drive the console's keyboard and pointer, which
likewise works before any guest software exists to do it.

Judge a GUI by its automation tree, queried through guest_run_in_session, not by
its pixels: pixels move with resolution, theme and DPI, and the capture is a
scaled thumbnail. Screenshots are for finding out what went wrong.`
